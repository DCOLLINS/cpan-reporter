NAME
    CPAN::Reporter - Provides Test::Reporter support for CPAN.pm

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Reporter;
      CPAN::Reporter::test( $cpan_dist, $system_command );

DESCRIPTION
    Not for end-user use.

USAGE
  "test()"
      CPAN::Reporter::test( $cpan_dist, $system_command );

    Given a "CPAN::Distribution" object and a system command to run
    distribution tests (e.g. "{make test}"), "test()" executes the command
    via "system()" while teeing the output. Based on the output, "test()"
    generates a sends a Test::Reporter report. It returns true if the
    captured output indicates that all tests passed and false, otherwise.

    user's home directory.

    *Explain option format and yes|no|ask*

    *   "email_from" -- email address of the user sending the test report
        (*required*)

        (default: no)
