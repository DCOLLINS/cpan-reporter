=head1 NAME

CPAN::Reporter::History - Read or write a CPAN::Reporter history log

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 1.07_02

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Interface for interacting with the CPAN::Reporter history file.  Most
methods are private for use only within CPAN::Reporter itself.  

However, a public function is provided to query the history file for
results for a particular distribution.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 C<<< have_tested() >>>

     @results = CPAN::Reporter::History::have_tested(
         dist => 'Dist-Name-1.23'
     );

The C<<< dist >>> argument should be the distribution tarball name without 
any filename suffix. From a C<<< CPAN::Distribution >>> object, this is provided
by the C<<< base_id >>> method.

If the named distribution is found in the CPAN::Reporter history file, this
function returns an array of hashes representing each test result.  Fields in
the hash include:

=over

=item *

C<<< dist >>> -- the base id

=item *

C<<< phase >>> -- phase the report was generated: either 'PL', 'make' or 'test'

=item *

C<<< grade >>> -- CPAN Testers grade: 'PASS', 'FAIL', 'NA' or 'UNKNOWN'

=item *

C<<< perl >>> -- perl version and patchlevel (if one exists)

=item *

C<<< platform >>> -- architecture name and OS version string
