TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

- Need a more complete grade/option table

            pass    fail    unknown na
    yes                                 
    no
    ask/yes
    ask/no

- Idea in ABNF form:
    option      ::= rule *( WSP rule )
    rule        ::= grade-list / ( [ grade-list ":" ] action )
    grade-list  ::= grade *( "/" grade )
    grade       ::= "pass" / "fail" / "unknown" / "na"
    action      ::= "yes" / "no" / "ask/yes" / "ask/no" / "ask"

- Rules without a grade-list are a fallback if no other rule applies; 
  rules are processed left to right, later rules overwrite earlier ones;
  grade-lists without actions are taken to mean "no"

- Check failed tests for prerequisite failures -- this could
  occur if tests were forced.  Such failures should be marked N/A.

- Test dist:
    - no prereqs
    - prereq failures

- Confirm up-to-date Test::Harness diagnostics

- Improve test coverage

- Include some/all of %ENV

- Include some of Config (compiler, make, lib/inc paths, etc.) and
  special variables like UID, EID, etc.

- Add TOC to report

- Check email addresses for validity (?)
