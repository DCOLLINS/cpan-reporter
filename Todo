TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

- Write prereq_pm report tests

- Generate prereq report from a sub-process

- Check prereq_pm for "perl" now that CPAN.pm passes it along

- Test installed versions of programs in a perl subshell to pick up PERL5LIB

- Check for system() call $? & 127 (only on Unix, though) or set a $SIG{INT}
  handler (for Win32); abort test without sending

- Need a more complete grade/option table

            pass    fail    unknown na
    yes                                 
    no
    ask/yes
    ask/no

- Idea in ABNF form:
    option      ::= rule *( [ "," ] WSP rule )
    rule        ::= grade-list / ( [ grade-list ":" ] action )
    grade-list  ::= grade *( "/" grade )
    grade       ::= "pass" / "fail" / "unknown" / "na" / "default"
    action      ::= "yes" / "no" / "ask/yes" / "ask/no" / "ask"

- Rules without a grade-list are a fallback if no other rule applies; 
  rules are processed left to right, later rules overwrite earlier ones;
  grade-lists without actions are taken to mean "yes" for those grades;
  "no" is the default fallback rule; default can be specified explicitly

- Confirm up-to-date Test::Harness diagnostics

- Look at CPANPLUS::Internals::Constants::Reports and try to 
  replicate that logic

- Add tests for the report itself

- Improve test coverage for utility/error handling

- Include some/all of %ENV

- Include some of Config (compiler, make, lib/inc paths, etc.) and
  special variables like UID, EID, etc.

- Check email addresses for validity (?)
