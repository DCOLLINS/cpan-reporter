TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

- Check for grading regex independently.  Track how many "pass" or "fail"
  regex match.  If ambiguous result, flag as UNKNOWN.  (Should help 
  handle autoinstall recursion.)
  
- Check for system() call $? & 127 (only on Unix, though) or set a $SIG{INT}
  handler (for Win32); abort test without sending; key question: is this
  success or fail for return code to CPAN?  Probably the latter.

- Add an interface for CPAN.pm to pass in test output directly (e.g. from 
  Expect.pm) for report generation.

- In test programs, check that temp space gets created -- skip if can't 
  set up the test properly

- Include some/all of %ENV

- Include some of Config (compiler, make, lib/inc paths, etc.) and
  special variables like UID, EID, etc.

- Need a more complete grade/option table

            pass    fail    unknown na
    yes                                 
    no
    ask/yes
    ask/no

- Idea in ABNF form:
    option      ::= rule *( [ "," ] WSP rule )
    rule        ::= grade-list / ( [ grade-list ":" ] action )
    grade-list  ::= grade *( "/" grade )
    grade       ::= "pass" / "fail" / "unknown" / "na" / "default"
    action      ::= "yes" / "no" / "ask/yes" / "ask/no" / "ask"

- Rules without a grade-list are a fallback if no other rule applies; 
  rules are processed left to right, later rules overwrite earlier ones;
  grade-lists without actions are taken to mean "yes" for those grades;
  "no" is the default fallback rule; default can be specified explicitly

- Consider changing OSX config file location to my_home from my_documents

- Confirm up-to-date Test::Harness diagnostics ( Note -- modern CPAN
  may be forcing 2.62 in some situations, but not all)

- Look at CPANPLUS::Internals::Constants::Reports and try to 
  replicate that logic

- Add tests for the report itself

- Improve test coverage for utility/error handling

- Check email addresses for validity (?)
